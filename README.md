# Description
A game of guessing words that are related to the sport of golf.  Golf is what many people consider a gentlemen's game,  it is the only sport in which a player plays against themselves.  The game teaches you the value of honesty, patiences, and good sportsmenship.  In the game of golf when you cheat you are only cheating yourself.  The rules of the game is to click the letters in the alphabet to reveal the word. You have six chances to guess the word, and just like in the real game of golf you only get one stroke at it!!

# Next Step:

The next step would be to put a putting ground with a golf ball, so that when the words picked are right it inches closer to the hole.  When guessed wrong it inches further away from the hole.
